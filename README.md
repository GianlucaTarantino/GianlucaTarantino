## Hi! I'm Gianluca Tarantino, a 17 years old Italian developer and gamer.

I love problem solving and pretty much everything regarding Computer Science and videogames.
Currently into [Pokémon Millennium](https://pokemonmillennium.net), biggest Nintendo community in Italy and one of the most important in Europe.

- 🔭 Currently working on some articles and some Computer Vision projects
- 💾 I'm also a Maker! With experience on Arduino and Raspberry boards
- 📏 Working for [Pokémon Millennium](https://pokemonmillennium.net)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Machine Learning and Data Science (Scikit, Tensorflow)
  - Web Components
- 📫 How to reach me: gianlutara@gmail.com or [@GianlucaTarantino](https://t.me/GianlucaTarantino) on Telegram

### Skills
- **Web Development**: I love Vanilla JS, but I know MERN and MEAN Stack too (I'm mostly a backend guy)
- **Desktop Development**: Node.JS (Electron), Golang, C++
- **Mobile Development**: Dart, Flutter, React Native
- **Embedded Development**: C/C++ with Arduino and STM boards, Python with Raspberry Pi
- **Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming fundamentals**
- **Algorithm and Data Structures** (currently studying them, but I love this branch of Computer Science)

### Projects
- [**httcli**](https://github.com/gianlucatarantino/httcli), a simple CLI to make HTTP Requests

### Tools
I mainly use Visual Studio Code for writing code, with Pylint and ESLint as linters. My main operating system is ChromeOS, on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon 1st Gen. My development environment is very minimalistic and tidy, so I always try to have less things possible on my PC.
