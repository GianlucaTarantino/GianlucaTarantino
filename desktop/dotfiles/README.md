# Dotfiles and other files

This is a very minimal and simple configuration, based on the wallpaper found at https://www.zerochan.net/1798586, by yugiohgirl, that represent Ramiel, the fifth Angel of Neon Genesis Evangelion. I literally fell in love with this wallpaper. The Polybar theme is by Aditya Shakya ([repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes)).

Here I mainly use Picom for the transparency and a minimal personalization of Polybar to have everything I need at glance, with a beautiful minimal design. i3 has some custom keybindings for the most used apps and has some default keybindings modified.
